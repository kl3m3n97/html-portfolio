<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I’m a driven and ambitious individual, born in 1997, and currently living in the vibrant city of Maribor, Slovenia. With a background in economics, I’ve built a strong foundation of knowledge, but my curiosity and determination have led me to embark on an exciting new journey as a web developer. My persistence and discipline are my superpowers, helping me tackle challenges head-on and continuously grow in my skills.

  When I’m not coding or learning something new, I’m likely hitting the gym, staying committed to both my physical and mental well-being. This balance of self-improvement and hard work shows that I’m not just building a career—I’m building a life of purpose and strength. I believe that with my mindset, there’s no limit to what I can achieve. The future is mine to code!
